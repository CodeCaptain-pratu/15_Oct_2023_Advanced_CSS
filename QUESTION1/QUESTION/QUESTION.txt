ANSWER:  
var() function allow us to store the value and reuse the code throughout the css stylesheet, making easier to maintain the code and make the global changes.

Purpose of var() function -
1) Reuse the code : we can store the value using the css variables, we can reuse the code throughout the css stylesheet which makes the code more cleaner and reduces the redundancy.

2) Global change : If we want to change the design. we just need to update the varibles once and the change will apply to all instances using the variables.

3) Consistency : Because of css variables we can ensure the consistent values for colors, spacing, fonts, and more throughout our entire design. Changing a value of the variable will automatically updated where the instances are used.
